From this day, I am using HUGO, switched from Wordpress to my own Angularjs SPA static site to HUGO... yay

I did thought, "Oh why not just use medium.com and get rid of all setting up hassles", then god spoke with this

At that point, I realised, I shouldn't host my amazing articles ( :P ) in others' platform :D :D

#### Markdown plugin for vscode

I am using this plugin for easy typing/creating markdown
[Markdown All in One](https://github.com/yzhang-gh/vscode-markdown).

Seems, MD is already supported by vscode but I installed it anyway :D :D

#### Date plugin for vscode

While creating blog post in text-editor, it hard to add date so I installed this plugin.

[insert Date Time](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemname=jsynowiec.vscode-insertdatestring)

    Ctrl+Alt+Shift+I then ISO // to insert iso date
