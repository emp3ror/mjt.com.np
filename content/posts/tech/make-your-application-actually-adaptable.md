Preparing draft for presentation on Frontend Reunited

## My History of javascript

- Slide/carousel
- Form validation in Client side
  - Password didnt match
  - Password length, must contains
- Username already used using api

- there comes templating
  - handlebars
- whole world is now on frontend with lots of serverless facilities

## Using task runners

- gulp/grup
- Webpack
  - little bit about es6 features (mostly of import)

## Patterns

- seperation of concerns
- feature based

### Scss

- Variables
- mixins

### Components

- tables
- charts

### Service layers

- intercepting APIs

### Response controlled Component

- Form builder
- Animations
- Pop ups

### Publish Subscribe pattern

- Redux
