      <description>why? Thought /var wouldnt need more than 5G of space, so I foolishly created partition of only 5G and set /var to it. You know when you got new ssd with only 256G space, you try to act cool and think you can optimize but the thing is I am too lazy to optimize everytime :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: I checked my old hard disk the HDD and found out, /var was given 21G space and it was 15G filled already&amp;hellip; Then my adrenaline rush of need to resize came strong and I am changing this state while writting this blog :sweat_smile: , if something goes wrong, I would be needing bootable pendrive :sweat_smile: :sweat_smile: /var /var is a standard subdirectory of the root directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems that contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation.</description>
