      <description>KTM trail series #7 - Taudaha After a gap, I join this series for 15k. I was feeling kindof sick, may be weather change but still I like running and completed it :D
Fist 1-2km was cool.. After running little hill, sun hit me up, I can feel my stomach digesting foods I ate earlier, also my body started saying &amp;ldquo;Man you were feeling sick, comman stop this race and return&amp;rdquo;.</description>
