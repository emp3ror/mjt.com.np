      <description>learning data mining
Nature of data After observation, we can get 3 types of data
 Nominal : which has label or tags, cant take mean, we can take percentage (frequecy) though eg, sex, taste
 Ordinal : Rank, satisfactions, mean may not be good&amp;hellip;
 Interval/Ratio : Measure, intervals like age, time, couts
     Customer Age Sex Groceries Chocobars Type Satisfied Bulk     1 18 Male Rs 140 2 Milk 1 2   1 23 Female Rs 270 2 Dark 3 3   1 21 Female Rs 160 2 White 2 4   1 27 Male Rs 180 2 Milk 1 2     Type is Nominal and can be displayed in pie chart or bar chart Satisfied is Ordinal and can&amp;rsquo;t be displayed in pie chart.</description>

      <description>JWT RFC7519 states:
JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted.</description>

I did thought, &amp;ldquo;Oh why not just use medium.com and get rid of all setting up hassles&amp;rdquo;, then god spoke with this message from medium.com At that point, I realised, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t host my amazing articles ( :P ) in others&amp;rsquo; platform :D :D
Hugo Hugo is open-source static site builder written in Go lang.</description>
